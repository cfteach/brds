<b>Synopsis: </b> No data scientist can work without a solid grasp of conditional probability and Bayesian reasoning. Bayesâ€™ theorem allows to update our beliefs based on the occurrence of new events, steering the inference towards the truth and assessing uncertainty in predictions. This course provides an introduction to Bayesian Reasoning in Data Science (<b>BRDS</b>) and will let you appreciate the basic building blocks of this approach through real-world examples across different areas. During the course you will learn concrete computational implementations, that will help students connect what they have read and heard with what they can program, reinforcing the material.

<b>Mini-projects:</b> Five bonus points on the homework can be obtained with a mini-project done before Thanksgiving week. See [mini-project template](https://cfteach.github.io/pyscr/) and check the source code of the html page. We discussed about using PyScript for mini-projects. PyScript is a framework that allows users to create rich Python applications in the browser using HTML's interface and the power of Pyodide, WASM, and modern web technologies. Examples of PyScript can be found at https://pyscript.net/. Examples of mini-project during the BRDS course can be found here:
